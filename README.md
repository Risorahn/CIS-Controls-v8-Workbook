# CIS-Controls-v8-Workbook
This workbook works very similar to the AuditScripts version from which this workbook was born. There are a number of differences and this version has been updated with CIS v8, added the mappings from each sub control to MITRE ATT&CK Techniques to Tactics, more metrics, built out math workbook to make your own metrics if you desired, added the asset type metrics and made it with an intuitive scoring system to best report back to leadership and document your policy and procedure links for ease of SOC 2 document management in regard to your security maturity. Please to leave feedback and make a branch if you wish to make a version of your own to better fit your environment.
